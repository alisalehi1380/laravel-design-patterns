#[Laravel Developer's Guide - Important Design Patterns]

Welcome to the Laravel Backend Developer's Guide! This document aims to provide you with essential design patterns commonly used in Laravel development. Understanding and applying these patterns will enhance the scalability, maintainability, and overall quality of your Laravel applications.
I developed each of them in diffrent branches by their names.
Feel free to add, modify, or expand upon these design patterns based on your project's requirements. Happy coding, and I hope these patterns enhance the quality of your Laravel applications! If you have any questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask.
Remember to customize the document with your own name or any additional patterns that may be relevant to your specific projects.

##[1. Repository Pattern]
The Repository Pattern is used to separate the data access logic from the application's business logic. It provides a centralized place to handle data retrieval and storage operations for database entities. Implementing this pattern makes it easier to switch between different data sources, such as databases or external APIs, without affecting the rest of the application.

<!-- 2. Service Layer Pattern
The Service Layer Pattern helps decouple the application's business logic from the controllers, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. Services are responsible for handling complex business operations and encapsulating the underlying business rules.

3. Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection is a crucial concept in Laravel. It allows you to inject dependencies into classes instead of hardcoding them, promoting loose coupling and improving testability. Laravel's built-in container makes implementing DI straightforward.

4. Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern enables you to implement event-driven behavior in your Laravel application. Observers listen for specific events and respond to them when triggered. This pattern is ideal for implementing features like event logging, sending notifications, or executing background tasks.

5. Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. While it should be used judiciously, in some cases, it can be helpful to manage a single shared resource throughout the application's lifecycle.

6. Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms or behaviors and make them interchangeable. This pattern is beneficial when you need to switch between different algorithms dynamically or want to encapsulate complex logic into separate classes.

7. Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern provides an abstraction for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It helps decouple the code from the specific implementation of the objects being created, making it easier to introduce new classes or change the instantiation process.
